Version: 0.4.0
Date: 2022-09-09

  Important:
    - You will need to change your calls as some parameters have changed.
    - Please read the entire changelog of this version carefully!

  Changes:
    - the order of parameters for the teleportation commands has changed. The surface the
      player is teleported to is now the last parameter and optional. Previously it was the
      second mandatory parameter.
    - Adjusted projectile speed of barrage command to be generally slower and speed up based
      on evolution and current player speed.
    - The teleport_distance command has received the delay parameter from teleport_delay_distance
    - The teleport_delay_distance command has been removed.
    - The teleport_delay command has been renamed to teleport.

  Features:
    - Added speed modifier and range modifier parameters to barrage command, allowing to adjust
      the maximum speed and range of projectiles.
    - Added target_force parameter to enemy_arty command, to allow to specify the force that
      the turret gets assigned to.
    - get_naked now restores the equipment energy to a percentage of the value it had when
      the armor got removed rather than removing any stored energy. It received two optional
      parameters battery and shields to configure the percentage of energy retained. Defaults
      to 50-75% and 0-20% respectively.
    - Added new function rain_item to spawn a specified item around a location.

  Bugfixes:
    - Fixed vacuum not picking up from belts in automatic mode.
    - Fixed player on fire not doing anything if player is dead when called. It will now
      delay until the player is alive again and then start the flames.

      walking) ran out.
    - Fixed not removing all armors from player in some situations when calling get_naked.
    - Fixed armor losing stored energy when it was dumped by dump_inv

      inventory was full.
