  "description": "[ALPHA] This is an early access release, as such errors and bugs may happen, which might cause you to lose progress in your save game. You have been warned!\nProvides some helper functionality for stream integration. Intended for Factorio streamers that seek to spice up their game by having viewers trigger actions in the game.\nThis mod does not do anything on its own. It merely provides a remote interface which needs to be called (e.g. via RCON) for things to happen. Highly configurable including just about all chat messages."
